# Misco
Misco is a collaborative project by gonzaloolmo19 and miguevrgo to build a performant, reproducible stock market forecasting pipeline in Rust. The initial goal is to implement a customizable neural network that learns from historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data (and optionally engineered features) for a training universe of tickers, then evaluates generalization on a separate test ticker set.
